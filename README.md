Android Screen Variations
Example Android project for learning how to support devices with different screen sizes, densities, and orientations.

If the Android Studio layout preview shows an error by default, then edit res/values/styles.xml as follows: change: <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar"> to: <style name="AppTheme" parent="Base.Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">

A good reference for information about the current Android version and device sizes in use is:

Screen variations refers to differences in screen size, screen density and orientation. Layouts and images must have variations for each combination of screen size, screen density and orientation.

Added this in the manifest.

Layout size variations
Create multiple layout directories that represent each screen size that your app supports. By default, each layout directory represents a layout for the portrait orientation.

There are two types of size qualifiers that we must add:

small, normal, large, etc.: To support devices from Android 3.1 (API 12) and earlier.
sw: To support devices from Android 3.2 (API 13) and higher.
res/layout
res/layout-land
res/layout-small: rarely used smaller phone
res/layout-normal: phone
res/layout-large: 7" tablets and above
res/layout-xlarge: 10" tablets and above
Map <= Android 3.1 (API 12) layout sizes to >= Android 3.2 (API 13) layout sizes

<= Android 3.1	>= Android 3.2	Device
layout-small	sw320dp	
layout-normal	sw	normal phone
layout-large	sw600dp	7" tablet
layout-large-land	w600dp	multi-pane layout
layout-xlarge	sw720dp	10" tablet (incl. Nexus 9); multi-pane layout with lrg details
320dp: a typical phone screen (240x320 ldpi, 320x480 mdpi, 480x800 hdpi, etc).
480dp: a tweener tablet like the Streak (480x800 mdpi).
600dp: a 7” tablet (600x1024 mdpi).
720dp: a 10” tablet (720x1280 mdpi, 800x1280 mdpi, etc).
Example sizes for a few devices:

nexus 7: layout-large-hdpi nexus 10: layout-xlarge-xhdpi

Orientation variation
Create multiple layout directories that represent each landscape orientation + screen size that your app supports. Append -land to each directory that is for the landscape orientation.

res/layout
res/layout-land
res/layout-small
res/layout-normal
res/layout-large
res/layout-xlarge
The complete set of directories for each size x orientation variation is shown below:

res/layout
res/layout-land
res/layout-small
res/layout-small-land
res/layout-normal
res/layout-normal-land
res/layout-large
res/layout-large-land
res/layout-xlarge
res/layout-xlarge-land
Image support for screen variations
Screen variations require that you create multiple images of various sizes for each image that is used in your app. There are four screen densities that need to be supported:

Density	Description	x of mdpi	Example device(s)
xxhdp	Extra extra high DPI	3.0	
xhdpi	Extra high DPI	2.0	
hdpi	High DPI	1.5	
mdpi	Medium DPI	1.0	
ldpi	Low DPI	0.75	
mdpi is the baseline image size. xhdpi is 2.0x (or double) the size of the mdpi image. xdpi is 1.5x the mdpi image size. ldpi is .75x the size of the mdpi image size.

Create the following directories to support the various screen densities:

res/drawable-xxhdpi
res/drawable-xhdpi
res/drawable-hdpi
res/drawable-mdpi
res/drawable-ldpi
Example sizes for a few devices:

nexus 5: drawable-xxhdpi
nexus 6: drawable-xxxhdpi. However, it has to scale these down slightly as the phone is between xxxhdpi and xxhdpi.
nexus 9: drawable-xhdpi
Create directories for screen variations
cd into this project, then run the following script.

./screen-variations.sh
